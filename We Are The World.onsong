We Are The World

Verse 1:
C                            F        G     C
There comes a time when we heed a certain call
           F          G                C
When the world must come together as one
             Am
There are people dying
             Em                     Dm
Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life
    F                  G
The greatest gift of all
 
Verse 2:
C               F         G     C
We can't go on pretending day by day
 F             G                          C
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
Am                 Em
We're all a part of God's great big family
   Dm
And the truth
F         G
You know love is all we need
 
Chorus:
            F   G                   C
We are the world, we are the children
            F                    G                  C
We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving
          Am                       Em
There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives
     Dm                       G                C
It's true we'll make a better day just you and me
 
Verse 3:
C                                          F         G     C
Well, send them your heart so they know that someone cares
 F                   G              C
And their lives will be stronger and free
  Am                   Em
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
Dm                                 G
And so we all must lend a helping hand

We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving
          Am                       Em
There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives
     Dm                       G                C
It's true we'll make a better day just you and me
 
Bridge:
            Ab                 Bb                 C
When you're down and out there seems no hope at all
           Ab                   Bb              C
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
                        Am             Em
Well, well, well, let's realize that a change can only come
     F
When we
                  G
stand together as one

            F                      G                  C
We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving
          Am                       Em

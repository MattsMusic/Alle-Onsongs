We  [F]walk by faith in God who burns
The [Eb]chariots with [Gm]fire

Lord of hosts Youâ€™re [Eb]with us with us in the [Gm]fire

Oh where else would  [F]we go but with the Lord of [Eb]hosts

The mountains [Eb]move into the [Gm]sea

O  [F]God who makes the mountains melt
Come [Eb]wrestle us and [Gm]win

Stitches
Shawn Mendes
Key: C

{start_of_verse}
I[Am] thought that I[G]'ve been hurt be[C]fore[F]
But [Am]no one's ever le[G]ft me quite this s[C]ore[F]
Y[Am]our words cut de[G]eper than a kn[C]ife[F]
Now I [Am]need someone to br[G]eathe me back to li[C]fe[F]
{end_of_verse}


{comment: Pre-Chorus}
G[F]ot a feeling that I'm go[G]ing under
B[Am]ut I know that I'll make it out alive
I[F]f I quit calling [G]you my lover
[Am]Move on


{start_of_chorus}
You watch me b[Am]leed until I can't br[G]eathe
I'm shaking[C], falling onto my kne[F]es
And now that [Am]I'm without your ki[G]sses
I[F]'ll be needing sti[C]tches
I'm tri[Am]pping over my[G]self,
I'm aching be[C]gging you to come he[F]lp
And now[Am] that I'm without your k[G]isses
I'l[F]l be needing stit[C]ches
{end_of_chorus}


{start_of_verse}
Ju[Am]st like a m[G]oth drawn to a f[C]lame[F]
Oh, you lu[Am]red me in, I co[G]uldn't sense the p[C]ain[F]
Y[Am]our bitter he[G]art cold to the t[C]ouch[F]
Now I'm gonna r[Am]eap what I s[G]ow
I'm left seeing [C]red on my own[F]

N.C.
And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches
N.C.
And now that I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches
